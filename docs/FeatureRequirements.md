# Outline Software Development Plan

This is an app which should allow a user to create lists of different categories using words, moving them around, assigning them to a user and taging. This app can be used to crate a shoping list, team composition list or list of animal types.

The app must be multi-purposful and allow the user to determine the list feel.
